    "A palindrome is a sentence that reads the same forwards as backwards, like \"A dog, a panic, in a Pagoda\" Usually, these take some work to make, but technically you can easily make a palindrome by taking any sentence and sticking it to itself backwards. For example, if you had the string \"Hello\", you could make a palindrome by appending \"olleH\" to the end, producing \"HelloolleH\". Make a function to do this using the skeleton below, and make sure it passes its tests!"
