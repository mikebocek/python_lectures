    "Sets are probably the most obscure and least used of the data structures, but in specific types of problems they are invaluable. Mathematically, a *set* is a unordered collection of unique items. The keys of a dictionary are an effective model for a set, because\n",

    "the way that python goes about doing this is to check the first item, then the second, then the third, and so on. This means that as your list grows, the time that it takes to find the element your interested in grows at the same rate. Surprisingly, in sets, Python uses a mathematical trick called *hashing* to make the time it takes to find the presence of an element *independent* of the size of the set (i.e. it takes the same amount of time regardless of how big the set is, within reason.)\n",

    "\n",
    "The distinction in performance between lists and sets is known in computer science as *asymptotic complexity*, which is sometimes informally known as \"Big-O,\" notated as $\\mathcal{O}$. Basically, computer scientists describe the complexity of an algorithm as the way that the runtime grows as the size of the input grows. Typically the easiest sort of complexity to calculate is the *worst case* complexity, which tells you how the problem scales if you get as unlucky as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the algorithm for finding whether a piece of data is contained in a list requires scanning through the list and looking at every element until it is found. In the worst case, the piece of data we are intersted in won't occur until the end of the list. Thus, the time it takes the program to run will scale *linearly* with the size of the list (i.e. if the length of the list doubles, it will take twice as long.) We say that the find algorithm on a list runs in linear, or $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the symbol for the complexity function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a set, the time would remain the same no matter how big the list is, because all of the data points are stored in a hash table. Thus, because the time is independent of the size of the set, we say that lookup in a set runs in constant time, which we notate as $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These might seem like pointless distinctions, but they can quickly become important. In some cases, there are important problems for which the best algorithms known run in *exponential time* or $\\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$. This means that even problems on very small datasets can quickly become intractable. As a good example, many passwords can be effectively cracked in a matter of hours if they are less than 8 characters, but a 15 character password would take many millenia to crack by the same algorithm. We owe the existence of effective internet security to the difficulty of solving problems that work in exponential time."
