    "Python variables are more flexible than just containers for numbers. They can also hold other kinds of data. One type of data that programs often must deal with is text. Programs might use text to store messages to the user, for example. They might download a website as text, and then count the number of times that a particular word appears. Even types of data that we might not traditionally think of as text, like DNA sequences, are often represented as strings.\n",

When you put a backslash \\ in a quote, Python treats this as a special character. The next character after the backslash can cause certain effects.
