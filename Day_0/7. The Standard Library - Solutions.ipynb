    "Python is a relatively small and tight language. Though it offers many useful building blocks as we've seen (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc), these are just that: building blocks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these fundemental, basic types, Python has a huge galaxy of additional modules and plugins that you can make use of in your code. These extend the language and make it possible to do almost anything that's possible with a computer. With Python, you you can create bots that look for cheap cars on Craiglist (I've done this.) You can run web servers. You can even use artificial intelligence and neural networks to recognize features in images, or even transfer the artistic style of a Picasso painting onto a picture (https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer, if you don't believe me!) \n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of notes, we'll quickly blaze through how to import packages, how to install new packages, and a few of the standard packages that ship with every installation of Python (known as the Python standard library.) You can find a full list of packages in the standard library, and extensive documentation for them at https://docs.python.org/3.5/py-modindex.html. Needless to say, there's too much stuff even in just the Standard Library to describe every package, so we'll focus on a handful that you might find useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the later lectures, we'll turn our full attention to a particular set of these packages, using what's known as the scipy stack (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn and scipy) to analyze and vizualize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the *math* package, which provides some helper functions that calculate square roots, cosines, and other things that Python cannot do with the built in functions. To do this, we just type"

It's a file type that is stored in plain text, but that's designed to represent nested structures of lists and dictionaries, containing text and numeric data. Basically every type of data that we've talked about so far can be stored in a JSON file, with the exception of File objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON has two major advantages:\n",
    "1. It is human readable. You can open a JSON file and clearly see the structure of the data\n",
    "2. It is supported by a variety of other programming languages, and is the major way of sending raw data around on the internet\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major drawbacks to using JSON:\n",
    "1. Since the files are stored as text, they can be quite large\n",
    "2. The format can only store lists, dictionaries, strings, numbers and booleans. It cannot functions or any of the custom objects we will encounter later\n",
